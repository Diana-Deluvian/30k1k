# Thirty Thousand / One Thousand

This is an online repository for all the new words I encounter, or books that catch my curiosity, while reading. The live site can be found [here](https://30k1k.netlify.app)

The motivation for this project is that other tools available weren't quite cutting it for me. As far as I know, there is no app that combines both of these features (words & books) in one place, and issues I'd commonly run into that obscure books might be unavaiable. These reasons, along with the desire to build things on my own and the fact that I now have full control over the UI, data, and features, made this a very worthwhile endevour. 

The name comes from two places: a native englishs speaker generally has around twenty thousand words in their vocabulary. Someone who is both native and is actively engaged in using the language (e.g. a writer) has thirty thousand (or more). I am at around twenty five thousand right now, so still a ways to go.
The one thousand comes from a statement Carl Sagan once made: 'if you were to put all the information stored in a humans DNA into books, it would fill one thousand novels". Both goals are of course arbitrary, but they are something to aim towards.

## Technologies

This app was built with the helpt of React as the front end framework, and bootstrap + SASS for styling. It is hosted on Netlify.

The backend is built in the NodeJS environment, using Express as the framework, passportjs with a local strategy and express-session for a session-based authentication system, and MongoDB as the data-persistence mechanism of choice. It is hosted on heroku.
