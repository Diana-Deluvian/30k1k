# Thirty Thousand / One Thousand

This is an online repository for all the new words I encounter, or books that catch my curiosity, while reading. The live site can be found [here](https://30k1k.netlify.app)

The motivation for this project is that other tools available weren't quite cutting it for me. As far as I know, there is no app that combines both of these features (words & books) in one place, and issues I'd commonly run into that obscure books might be unavaiable. These reasons, along with the desire to build things on my own and the fact that I now have full control over the UI, data, and features, made this a very worthwhile endevour. 

## Technologies

This app was built with the helpt of React as the front end framework, and bootstrap + SASS for styling. It is hosted on Netlify.

The backend is built in the NodeJS environment, using Express as the framework, passportjs with a local strategy and express-session for a session-based authentication system, and MongoDB as the data-persistence mechanism of choice. It is hosted on heroku.
